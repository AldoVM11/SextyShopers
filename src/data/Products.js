Due to weekly seasonality, correlation spikes every 7 days far into the past. The blue range represents confidence, and any day that scores within the threshold is considered not correlate",

It can be seen that there is a weekly correlation that has not yet been eliminated.

All but seven days in the past have been uncorrelated to the point that they can be considered 'uncorrelated.' With this, the models will not make assumptions about seasonality, which makes prediction not dominated by average results.",
